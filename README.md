# CUBE

A small Vulkan rendering engine. Currently it's about learning something about
[Vulkan](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/). Since this is currently a spare time project let's see what will
become of it. At some point I plan to make this build on
[Android](https://developer.android.com/index.html) as well.

Further ideas are to add networking, audio capabilities amd input handling too.

## Linux

[![Coverity Status](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/12717/badge.svg)](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/aseuss-cube)

The project is developed on Linux and currently the focus lies on that.

## Dependencies

To build the project you need [CMake](https://cmake.org/) in version 3.2 or
later. You will also need the [LunarG Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home)
and [Assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp).
